Full-Stack Database Design and Implementation (SQL & NoSQL) - Group Project(2 members)

● Designed a normalized relational database from the Centralized Multi-Hospital Patient Management System,
including conceptual and physical data models with Crow’s Foot notation, resolving complex many-to-many
relationships using associative entities
● Implemented the database schema using SQL; developed procedures, functions, and advanced queries involving
joins, subqueries, set operations, and CTEs for data retrieval and manipulation
● Migrated key relational tables to a denormalized MongoDB schema with embedded documents; developed
expressive find queries and aggregation pipelines using operators like $group, $unwind, $project, and $filter to
support NoSQL-based analytics
